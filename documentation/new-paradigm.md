## New Paradigm

TODO - rename this

### Additional 3d geometry generation paradigm

### 3D
- Define a 3d geometry (sphere for instance)
- include an origin point or points in the definition
- define a polyhedron with the same origin point or points
- define inscribed curves inside polygon surfaces of polyhedron, which are split into curve sections corresponding to each line section
- project endpoints of polyhedra to surface of 3d geometry center curve segments
- project points of inscribed curves to 3d surface as well
- 


### Pattern
- allow for slicing of 3d surfaces parallel or perpendicular to segment direction




### Plan of action
- begin with completing implementation of spine curve
